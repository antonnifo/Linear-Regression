The objective of a linear regression model is to find a relationship between one or more features **(independent variables or inputs or predictors)** and a continuous target variable **(dependent variable or output or response).** When there is only feature it is called **Uni-variate Linear Regression** and if there are multiple features, it is called **Multiple Linear Regression.**
Regression searches for relationships among variables.
